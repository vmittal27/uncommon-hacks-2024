## Description

This project integrates multiple services (Streamlit, Google Maps API, and MongoDB) to provide a web application that allows users to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions based on vehicle type and travel distance. Users input car details (year, make, and model) and select a start and destination point. The application then calculates the CO2 emissions for the trip and the number of trees needed to offset these emissions. Furthermore, the application encourages users to cut their driving distance shorter and use greener methods of transportation to reduce their carbon footprint by tangibly displaying the reduced amount of carbon dioxide emitted and a fewer amount of trees required to offset their carbon emissions. 

## Features

- Car details input using Streamlit and MongoDB for vehicle data storage and retrieval.
- Dynamic search boxes for car make and model suggestions.
- Integration with Google Maps API for places autocomplete and distance matrix calculations.
- Emissions calculation based on vehicle data and distance traveled.
- Provides suggestion for user to reduce their carbon emission
